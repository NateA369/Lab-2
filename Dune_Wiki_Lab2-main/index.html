    <h3>HE WHO CONTROLS THE SPICE CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE</h3>
    <p>A young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, he must travel to the most 
        dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. 
        As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the galaxy’s exclusive supply of spice—a 
        commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their 
        fear will survive. There are six books written by the original author before his untimely death.
        The series was completed by his son and friend.
